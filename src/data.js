Believers in backmasking thenk they can hear Hail Satan and other messages to Satan in some songs played in reverse, such as Walk This Way by Aerosmith. The variation Ave Satani, though grammatically incorrect, is sometimes used, likely orginating from its use by Jerry Goldsmith in his theme music to The Omen',
